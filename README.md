# Simple content management system with self written PHP framework
I wrote this framework few years ago. 

This CMS includes:
- Pages with category
- Publish status of the pages
- Dynamic user access control with roles
- Front-end to display the content and pages

ActiveRecord used as the database class in this framework. An improved version of the framework has been used in several projects with customized add-on modules and functionalities.
